# Angry-Birds

About:
We are trying to build a game that replicates Angry Birds. We have a few different characters, birds and pigs, which will have separate mechanics. 

How to play: 
At the moment we have not decided ehar kind of controls we would like to use but here is a base line. Each bird will have a specific Temporary fly time, use these carefully to navigate around obstacles and kill the pigs.
